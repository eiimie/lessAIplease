<h1>Less AI, Please!</h1>

<i>Less AI Please!</i> is a simple web extension that automatically adds operators to every Google search made with the extension active. These operators reduce the amount of AI generated results that show up. Alternatively, there is a secondary setting that allows you to filter out results that were made <i>past</i> 2022: in other words, you'll only see results from <i>before</i> the year 2022. This will remove nearly every single piece of AI content out there, but it may not be useful for everybody. 

I originally made this because, as a student, sometimes I just want to filter out AI results because I need accurate information. AI is not always accurate, or can even spread misinformation. 

This extension is made for...
- <b>Academics</b>, <b>researchers</b>, or other <b>professionals</b> who require high-quality, curated information rather than AI-generated information
- <b>Content curators</b> who prefer to use original content over AI-generated material
- <b>Artists</b> who need accurate references
- <b>Anyone else</b> who simply doesn't want AI results for any reason! 

Please note that...
- This extension cannot get rid of <i>every</i> AI result, because some AI results are simply not tagged as AI. 
- This extension also only applies to Google searches. Searching on Pinterest, for example, could still result in AI results.
- There may be false positives - i.e. some results that aren't AI, but mention it instead, might be filtered out by mistake. This includes results that may mention Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, etc. 

<b>Operators</b>
This extension uses <i>operators</i> to filter out AI results. When you make a search, it is automatically amended with the following operators to filter out results that contain the following... 
- "AI"
- "Prompt"
- "Generate"
- "Midjourney"

You can turn either setting (general AI removal, or 2022 removal) off at any time in the extension's popup. This is useful for anybody who might not always want/need to filter out AI results, or who want to toggle between different search strategies. 

Thank you for reading this! I hope you enjoy this extension. If you need to contact me for any reason, my information is on my profile. Happy surfing!
